This is a clone of Brooklyn Pennant Ale pale ale from the book [CloneBrews: Homebrew Recipes for 150 Commercial Beers][book]. 

This is v0.3 of this clone. Made `v0.1` on [2013-05-27](http://recology.info/beer_recipes/2013-05-27-brooklyn-pennant-ale_V0.1.html), and `v0.2` on [2014-01-05](http://recology.info/beer_recipes/2014/01/05/brooklyn-pennant-ale_v0.2/) - nearly one year ago to the day! `v0.3` is similar to `v0.2` in that I'm using Nugget and Saaz hops instead of Fuggles and Willamette, but using, as recipe states, the 3 other hops (Perle, German Hallertau, Cascade). 

### Ingredients:

+ 11 lbs British 2 row pale malt
+ 9 oz British crystal malt
+ 6 oz aromatic malt
+ Hops
	+ 2 oz. Nugget (instead of Fuggles)
	+ 1.5 oz. Saaz (instead of Willamette)
	+ 1/3 oz. Perle
	+ 1/3 oz. Hallertau
	+ 1/3 oz. Cascade
+ 1 tsp. Irish moss 
+ Wyeast 1968 London ESB
+ 1.25 cups Muntons extra-light DME

### Steps:

1. I'm doing all grain, so I use a mash tun. Warmed up water in pot on stove to 154 degrees F. Then poured the whole three malts together into the cooler, and poured enough water on top of the malts to cover them.  I stirred occasionally and measured temperature. If it was too cold I put in some hot water.  After 90 min., vorlofted a bit, sparged with hotter water (160 deg F) a few times, and added back to pot. 
2. Brought volume in pot up to about 5 gallons. Bring to boil.
3. Add 
	+ 1 oz. Nugget hops (for bittering)
	+ 1 oz. Saaz hops (for bittering)
4. Boil for 45 min
5. Add
	+ 1/3 oz. Perle hops (for flavor)
	+ 1/3 oz. German Hallertau hops (for flavor)
	+ 1 tbsp irish moss
	+ (put in the copper tubing apparatus to sterilize for the last 15 min. of boil)
6. Boil for 14 minutes
7. Add aroma hops
	+ 1/3 oz. Cascade hops
	+ 1/3 oz. Nugget hops
8. Boil for 1 minute 
	+ Measure initial gravity at this point, should be 1.055 (if not matching, perhaps put in more sugar if number too low, or more water if number too high)
9. Remove pot from stove and cool down as fast as possible to temperature ideal for the yeast - I used the copper tubing I put in the boil earlier.
10. Transfer cooled down wort to primary fermenter (carboy)
11. Put in yeast when temperature is right (yeast, pitched yeast at 68-72 degrees F)
12. On 2015-01-xx moved to secondary fermenter (bucket)
13. Bottled on 2015-01-xx

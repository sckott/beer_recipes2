This is a clone of Brooklyn Pennant Ale pale ale from the book [CloneBrews: Homebrew Recipes for 150 Commercial Beers][book]. 

This is v0.2 of this clone. Made v0.1 on [2013-05-27](http://recology.info/beer_recipes/2013-05-27-brooklyn-pennant-ale_V0.1.html). There are some definite differences from v0.1 of this recipe - I forgot to get the extra few ounces of crystal and aromatic malts at the brew shop, and I bought Nugget and Saaz hops in bulk pellets a while back, so just using those in this recipe instead of the suggested mix of 5 different varietals. 

### Ingredients:

+ 11 lbs ESB malt
+ 9 oz British crystal malt
+ 6 oz aromatic malt
+ Hops
	+ 2 oz. Nugget (instead of Fuggles)
	+ 1.5 oz. Saaz (instead of Willamette)
+ 1 tsp. Irish moss 
+ Wyeast 1450 Denny's Fav (was supposed to use Wyeast 1968 London ESB)
+ 1.25 cups Muntons extra-light DME

### Steps:

1. I'm doing all grain, so I use a mash tun. Warmed up water in pot on stove to 154 degrees F. Then poured the whole three malts together into the cooler, and poured enough water on top of the malts to cover them.  I stirred occasionally and measured temperature. If it was too cold I put in some hot water.  After 90 min., vorlofted a bit, sparged with hotter water (160 deg F) a few times, and added back to pot. 
2. Brought volume in pot up to about 5 gallons. Bring to boil.
3. Add 
	+ 1 oz. Nugget hops (for bittering)
	+ 1 oz. Saaz hops (for bittering)
4. Boil for 45 min
5. Add
	+ 1/3 oz. Nugget hops (for flavor)
	+ 1/3 oz. Saaz hops (for flavor)
	+ 1 tbsp irish moss
	+ (put in the copper tubing apparatus to sterilize for the last 15 min. of boil)
6. Boil for 14 minutes
7. Add aroma hops
	+ 1/2 oz. Nugget hops
	+ 2/10 oz. Saaz hops
8. Boil for 1 minute 
	+ Measure initial gravity at this point, should be 1.055 (if not matching, perhaps put in more sugar if number too low, or more water if number too high)
9. Remove pot from stove and cool down as fast as possible to temperature ideal for the yeast - I used the copper tubing I put in the boil earlier.
10. Transfer cooled down wort to primary fermenter (carboy)
11. Put in yeast when temperature is right (Wyeast 1450 Denny's Fav, pitch yeast at 68-72 degrees F)
12. On 2014-01-11 moved to secondary fermenter (bucket)
